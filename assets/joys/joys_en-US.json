    "scriptureName": "2 Corinthians",
    "scriptureChapter": "5:14",
    "scriptureVerse": "For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.",
    "prelude": "  We all need some kind of motivation to encourage us to be good people or to do good deeds. Basically, there are two kinds of motivation: positive and negative. Some people need positive motivation, while some people—or even animals—require negative motivation before they are stirred to do what they should do.",
    "laugh": "  On his birthday, Mr. Chang received a talking parrot from a close friend. Unfortunately, the parrot had a terrible attitude and constantly used foul language—either cursing people or speaking crude words. Mr. Chang tried very hard to change the parrot’s behavior. He spoke politely to it, played gentle music, and tried everything he could think of, but nothing worked.\n\nEventually, Mr. Chang began yelling at the parrot, and the parrot yelled back. He then shook the parrot angrily, which only made it more furious and even ruder. Finally, in a moment of uncontrollable rage, he put the parrot into the freezer. He heard the parrot screaming, kicking wildly, and shouting—then suddenly everything went silent. For a minute and a half, there was not a single sound.\n\nTerrified, Mr. Chang exclaimed, “Oh no, I’ve killed it!” He immediately opened the freezer door.\n\nThe parrot calmly walked out, stepped onto Mr. Chang’s outstretched hand, and said, “I believe my rude words and actions must have offended you. I will make every effort to improve my behavior. I am truly sorry and hope you can forgive me.”\n\nMr. Chang was shocked by the parrot’s sudden change in attitude. Just as he was about to ask what caused such a dramatic transformation, the parrot continued, “May I ask what that featherless bird inside did wrong?”",

Motivation rooted in love can help us continue to do what is right even in difficult circumstances.\n\nThe Apostle Paul understood and personally experienced the love of Christ Jesus. That love enabled him to faithfully complete the mission Jesus entrusted to him despite persecution and hardship. He said that Christ’s love was like a force constantly pushing him forward. Since we know that Christ died for all, all have died. And He died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and was raised again for them.\n\nLove is the strongest and most powerful motivation.",

    "laugh": "  Barbara Watters, host of a current affairs magazine, went to a place called Kabul before the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan to do a story on the theme of gender roles. She found that the local women had a habit of always walking five times slower than their husbands. She didn't understand why. Recently, she returned to Qab and found that the women there still followed their husbands in this way. Although the Taliban regime had been overthrown, these women were still happy to adhere to this tradition. When interviewing one of the women, Miss Walters, driven by curiosity, asked, 'Why are you so happy to uphold this tradition that you once tried so hard to overthrow?' The woman looked intently at Miss Walters and answered without hesitation, 'Because of landmines!'",

You yearn to find an unshakable anchor amidst the ever-changing complexities of human relationships, to find true peace. The poet David reminds us that only by holding fast to the unchanging true God can you fear not even as you walk through the valley of the shadow of death, for you know that God is always with you. His staff can help you turn back from the wrong path, and His rod will guide you on the right way. With the Lord God with you, you can no longer fear and can enjoy a peace that surpasses all understanding. Today, try telling God your innermost fears through prayer.",

One day, during class, the Chinese teacher assigned an essay topic: 'Me Thirty Years Later.' Here is Xiao Mei's essay: \n\n 'The weather was nice today. I was driving my Rolls-Royce, the gift my husband gave me for our wedding anniversary, wearing the three-carat diamond ring he just bought me, and the ruby ​​necklace he gave me for my birthday last month. I took my adorable twins to Da'an Forest Park. We were strolling through the park, surrounded by birdsong and fragrant flowers, attracting envious glances from everyone around us. Suddenly, an old woman, reeking of foul odor and covered in filth, who looked homeless, rushed out from the roadside, head bowed, begging me for something in a low voice. It nearly scared my two little ones. Startled, I looked closer and exclaimed, 'Oh my god! It's my fifth-grade Chinese teacher!'",

    "talk": "  Forgiving is a decision, not a matter of feeling. The feeling of being hurt can cloud our minds. The more we dwell on the harm others have done to us, the deeper we sink into the abyss of bitterness and resentment. In reality, the person who hurt you may have already forgotten you completely. While you are losing your appetite, they may be feasting; while you are unable to sleep at night, they may be sound asleep. No wonder some say, 'A person who doesn't forgive is like someone who has drunk poison and wishes for the other to die.' However, when we decide to obey God's word and forgive, we are healed from our hurt, freed, and once again receive God's grace of forgiveness. Why not be wise and choose to forgive those who hurt you?",

He didn't know how to bring it up, so he asked his doctor. \n\nThe doctor told him a simple test, 'You can do this: stand forty feet away from her and speak to her in your normal conversational voice. See if she can hear you. If she can't hear you, move the distance to thirty feet, then twenty feet, until she can hear you.' \n\n That evening, Lao Wang sat in the living room while his wife cooked in the kitchen. He thought, 'I'll stand about forty feet away from her and see how she reacts!' So he asked his wife in his normal voice, 'Honey, what are we having for dinner tonight?' There was no response. Lao Wang moved closer to the kitchen, about thirty feet away, and asked his wife again, 'Honey, what are we having for dinner tonight?' Still no response. He went to the dining room, about twenty feet away from his wife, and asked again, 'Honey, what are we having for dinner tonight?' Still no response. Therefore, he went to the kitchen doorway, about ten feet away from his wife, and asked again, 'Honey, what are we having for dinner tonight?' Again, no response. Lao Wang walked up behind his wife and asked, 'Honey, what are we having for dinner tonight?' His wife replied, 'Honey, this is the fifth time, Kung Pao Chicken!",

When the old man started eating his fries, a young man approached their table and politely offered to buy them an extra meal. The old man said they didn't need it, as they were used to sharing everything. Those near their table noticed the old woman hadn't eaten a bite; she sat there watching her husband eat, occasionally taking a sip of her drink. Again, the young man came over and asked permission to buy them a meal. This time, the old woman said, 'No need, thank you, we're used to sharing everything.' Finally, the old man finished eating and wiped his burger clean with a tissue. The young man approached the old woman again. Seeing that she hadn't eaten anything, he asked, 'What are you waiting for?' The old woman calmly replied, 'I'm waiting for his dentures!'",

Unexpectedly, when she brought it home, its first words were, 'Give me a kiss, baby!'\n\n Sister Shen thought, 'Oh no, people will think I taught it that. This will completely ruin my ladylike image.'\n\n So she tried everything to teach the parrot to speak more refined things. But the parrot was stubborn and only knew one phrase: 'Give me a kiss, baby!' What to do? Sister Shen was at a loss when she heard that the pastor also had a male parrot, and that parrot not only didn't use foul language, but was also a devout believer, spending most of its time praying. So Sister Shen asked the pastor for help. After understanding her purpose, the pastor said to her with some difficulty, 'This is difficult. Actually, I haven't deliberately taught that parrot anything. Its devotion is probably due to its long-term exposure to this environment!' Seeing Sister Shen's disappointment, the pastor said, 'How about this, bring your parrot to me. I'll put them together, hoping that after a while, your parrot will be influenced. That's all I can do. Whether it works or not depends on God's will.' Sister Shen was overjoyed. That was the only way. There's a saying, 'One who stays near vermilion gets stained red,' so we took the parrots to the pastor's house, and he put the two parrots together. At first, the female parrot was a little reserved. Seeing the male parrot silently praying in a corner of the cage, she didn't have the heart to disturb him. But she couldn't resist and finally said, 'Give me a kiss, my darling!' Hearing this, the male parrot stopped praying, turned to look at the female parrot, and suddenly, tears streamed down his face as he said, 'Thank God, my prayer has finally been answered!'",

I am a student, spending my days in the classroom, completely oblivious to everything. My three family members get along very well, and the house is generally harmonious. However, when my grades are poor, my father turns on me, cruelly beating me until I'm covered in bruises and prostrate on the ground. My mother stands by, either indifferent or detached, never intervening, and sometimes even aiding and abetting the abuse.'

Ten minutes later, he climbed into bed, and to my surprise, he even hugged and kissed me... But even so, I felt like he was thinking about something else. I felt I needed to have a serious talk with him, but he was already asleep, so I lay beside him and silently cried. 'I'm absolutely certain now that he has another woman.

It's something that hasn't happened yet, but you imagine how it will happen. The more you think about it, the more anxious you become, as if it's about to happen right before your eyes. In the end, it never happened. The Bible gives us the best prescription to help us get rid of unnecessary anxiety. That is to tell God what you want. Whether it's a big or small matter, you can tell God in prayer anytime, anywhere; this is what 'all things' means. Philippians 4:7 goes on to say that the result of telling God is that you will have an unexpected peace and tranquility in your heart.

But change requires courage, even putting aside pride. Think about it, what habits do you need to change? What attitudes do you need to change? When you decide to change yourself but lack the ability, you can pray to the Lord Jesus for help. Because when you accept Him as your personal Savior, you are already a new creation. You have the new mindset and new power that the Lord Jesus gives you, because the old must pass away, for the new is coming!",

Complaining not only affects our mood, but it's also futile. If we could look at the outcome from a positive perspective, our mood would be different. In fact, God wants us to give thanks in all things. That is to say, whether things are satisfactory or unsatisfactory, since they have already happened, there must be a good purpose in God's will. Gratitude is believing and accepting that everything has a good purpose, even if we can't see the benefits now, but looking back in the future, we will find it full of God's blessings. As the saying goes, 'A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.' Think about three things you can thank God for, and then speak your thanks and praise to Him.",
